# Crystal Collector

This game was an early javascrpit homework assignment. The goal is to click the "engrams" to acculumate a score that matches the random target. Each new game assigns non-repeating random values to the engrams.

I am revisiting this game as I dive into typescript. The goal is to take an object oriented approach while experimenting with typescript.
